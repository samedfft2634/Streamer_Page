This project is my first freelance job after finishing Frontend Development Bootcamp. It was a very enjoyable experience for me. I would like to thank my friend who helped me to complete this project. We finished it in one day. We used Material UI. I love this library and with many projects i have learned it well for now. Since my friend is an expert in the freelancing field, he asked me to get experience by helping him with this job and at the end of the project he showed me how to upload the page to a data management system called cpanel. I thank my friend for his helpfulness and kindness.
